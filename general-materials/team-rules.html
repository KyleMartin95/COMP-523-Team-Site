        <h2>Team Behavior</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Any impromptu meetings (meetings scheduled ~36 hours or less beforehand) are optional.</li>
            <li>We will wait 10 minutes for a team member to arrive to a scheduled meeting before starting without them.</li>
            <li>Team members are expected to use Group Me for any quick updates that the rest
                of the team needs to be notified about. Any communication regarding the project itself, should be made with Slack in the appropriate channel.
            </li>
            <li>A 24 hour heads up must be made to the rest of the team for any deadlines that will not be made</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Coding Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We have chosen to use packages such as ESlint to handle outlining and enforcing code styling within our projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                There will be a branch for each sprint i.e. 'sprint2' which will then have seperate developement branches for each team member.
                 Whenever a team member has finished and thouroughly tested what they have been working on they will merge their development branch into
                 the appropriate sprint branch. At the end of each sprint, the branch for that sprint will be merged with master which will then be put in
                 production on cloudapps.
            </li>
