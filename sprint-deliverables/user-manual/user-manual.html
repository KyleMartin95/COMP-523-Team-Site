        <h2>How To Use</h2>
        <p> ChickenBus operates on a web-based portal, and can be accessed freely. A mobile
          application is currently being developed to be deployed by the end of 2017. In order to access bus route information
          simply enter your current location and your desired location in the search panel
          along with when you would like the departure to take place.

        <h2>FAQS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What if nothing is returned when I enter my origin, destination, and departure time?
            - Then it is likely there is not a route within your specified time frame, or radius.
            It is equally likely that we do not have any bus route information for your current area.
