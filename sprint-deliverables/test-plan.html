        <h2>System Testing</h2>
        <p>  Since we are currently in development, and only have access to sample data,
          the majority of our test cases involve simulating UX and
          backend communication. We expect our UX to operate with similar ease to Google Maps
          or other routing applications. Besides preventing any user confusion, possible breaks
          to avoid are centrally focused around entered locations returning incorrect results
          on the map or a route that is irrelevant. Lastly, the most important testing would be for our routing
          algorithm, in which case an undesirable route or a non-optimal route is returned when there
          exists a more optimal chain of routes, for example.
        </p>
        <h2>Freelance Testing</h2>
        <p>  After a sample database is further collected and we shift focus from web to mobile development,
        sets UNC students and colleagues of our client might be asked to test the application given a
        list of sample paramaters. To test the different groups of users, we will ask UNC students to
        plan a trip ahead of time as if they were visiting a location as a tourist to test usability,
        and colleagues of our client in Nicaragua to test practicality.</p>
