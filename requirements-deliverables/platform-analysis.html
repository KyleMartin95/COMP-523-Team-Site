        <h1>Platform Analysis and Selection</h1>
        <p>
            We chose to use a combination of ReactJS as our front-end, ExpressJS and NodeJS for back-end, MySQL as our database, and React Native as our mobile solution.
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>Front-end:</strong> Choice for ReactJS was to allow better cross-platform adaptation when we eventually move to a mobile implementation with React Native<br>
          <strong>Back-end:</strong> Choice for NodeJS + ExpressJS was to have a uniform language across the application (JavaScript), as well as make maintenance easier<br>
          <strong>Database:</strong> Choice for MySQL was becasue we need a relational data base for routing purposes, also due to prior experiences<br>
          <strong>Mobile:  </strong> Choice for React Native allows for direct transition from Web based appliaction to mobile without additional native development
        </p>
        <h3>Alternatives
        </h3>
        <h4>Front-end</h4>
        <p>AngularJS<br>
            Pros: Structured MVC model, two way data binding<br>
            Cons: Less compaitible for mobile platforms than React</p>
        <p>No framework<br>
            Pro: None<br>
            Cons: Slower development, no access to library functions</p>
        <h4>Back-end</h4>
        <p>Java or Ruby on Rails<br>
            Pros: More robust back-end functions with greater expandability<br>
            Cons: Different langauage, slower development cycle
        </p>
        <h4>Mobile</h4>
        <p>Cordova<br>
            Pros: Implmentable with just HTML, CSS, and Javascript alone<br>
            Cons: Less fluid scrolling on IOS, less close knit compatibility with ReactJS
        </p>
        <p>Swift + Java<br>
            Pros: API access for all platform functionalities, more stable application<br>
            Cons: Need to develop on multiple platforms, long learning curve and development cycle unfit for project
        </p>
        <h4>Database</h4>
        <p>PostgreSQL<br>
            Pros: Object relational<br>
            Cons: Less experience</p>
        <p>MongoDB<br>
            Pros: JSON like syntax for storing data, parse easily<br>
            Cons: not relational</p>
        </p>
