            The ChickenBus project aims to collect and provide bus route information to underdeveloped countries through a robust application accessed via web, os, and android (preferred). The business propogates with a down-up information leverage model hoping to sell data to competitors who currently are focusing on more economically developed countries (top-down).

            The scope of our development would initially involve creating two interfaces; one for users (ranging from locals to budget travelers) to access transportation-routes, scheduling, and other information relevant to their locations/destinations, and another to enable hired 'boots on the ground' employees to acquire and log this information into the database.

            Our client has given us several examples of applications that he is keen on which offer similar services; i.e. Rome2Rio, TransLoc, VoyHoy, BusBud, etc. The current plan is to use the React Native environment to create these over mock data. Our client's end goal is to have something deployable by December.
